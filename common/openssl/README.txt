Building OpenSSL on Windows is......challenging.

32 bit seems to be ok but 64 bit is quite frustrating. If you cannot get get the libraries to build try and find already built ones for your platform.

I'm including the Windows binaries in these paths for linking but for other platforms you'll need to supply them in this folder.
